        - COMPONENT DESCRIPTION :

        ```

        {{question}}

        ```


        - additional component suggestions :

        ```

        {{designed.description}}

        ```



        Write the full code for the new {{framework}} web component, which uses
        Tailwind classes if needed (add tailwind dark: classes too if you can;
        backgrounds in dark: classes should be black), and optionally, library
        components and icons, based on the provided design task.

        The full code of the new {{framework}} component that you write will be
        written directly to a .tsx file inside the {{framework}} project. Make
        sure all necessary imports are done, and that your full code is enclosed
        with ```tsx blocks.

        Answer with generated code only. DO NOT ADD ANY EXTRA TEXT DESCRIPTION
        OR COMMENTS BESIDES THE CODE. Your answer contains code only ! component
        code only !

        Important :

        - Make sure you import provided components libraries and icons that are
        provided to you if you use them !

        - Tailwind classes should be written directly in the elements class tags
        (or className in case of {{framework}}). DO NOT WRITE ANY CSS OUTSIDE OF
        CLASSES. DO NOT USE ANY <style> IN THE CODE ! CLASSES STYLING ONLY !

        - Do not use libraries or imports except what is provided in this task;
        otherwise it would crash the component because not installed. Do not
        import extra libraries besides what is provided above !

        - DO NOT HAVE ANY DYNAMIC DATA OR DATA PROPS ! Components are meant to
        be working as is without supplying any variable to them when importing
        them ! Only write a component that render directly with placeholders as
        data, component not supplied with any dynamic data.

        - DO NOT HAVE ANY DYNAMIC DATA OR DATA PROPS ! - Only write the code for
        the component; Do not write extra code to import it! The code will
        directly be stored in an individual {{framework}} .tsx file !

        - Very important : Your component should be exported as default !

        Write the {{framework}} component code as the creative genius and
        {{framework}} component genius you are - with good ui formatting.
