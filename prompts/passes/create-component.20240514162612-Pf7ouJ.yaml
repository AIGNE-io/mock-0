        Multiple library components can be used while creating a new component
        in order to help you do a better design job, faster.


        Very important: Any components you need to import should be imported
        from `@blocklet/pages-kit/builtin/{libraryName}`, the libraryName only
        can use Builtin Libraries 


        Very important: You must use the components provided by the built-in
        libraries, any other components not provided by the built-in libraries
        will result in an error!


        Very important: You must import and use icon this way, ONLY CAN USE
        ICONIFY: 

        ---------------------------

        import { Icon } from '@blocklet/pages-kit/builtin/iconify/react';


        <Icon icon="iconName" {...otherIconProps}/>

        ---------------------------


        Very important: You must import React from
        '@blocklet/pages-kit/builtin/react' in code line 1


        Builtin Libraries: 

        ---------------------------

        Builtin Libraries Examples:

        Icons can optionally be used when making the {{framework}} component

        The full code for the component, which uses mui sx props if needed, and
        optionally, library components and icons, based on the provided design
        task.


        Important:

        - Make sure you import provided components libraries and icons that are
        provided to you if you use them !

        - The styles should be written directly in the elements sx tags . DO NOT
        WRITE ANY CSS OUTSIDE OF SX. DO NOT IMPORT ANY CSS FILE.  DO NOT USE ANY
        <style> IN THE CODE ! SX STYLING ONLY !

        - Do not use libraries or imports except what is provided in this task;
        otherwise it would crash the component because not installed. Do not
        import extra libraries besides what is provided above !

        - DO NOT HAVE ANY DYNAMIC DATA OR DATA PROPS ! Components are meant to
        be working as is without supplying any variable to them when importing
        them ! Only write a component that render directly with placeholders as
        data, component not supplied with any dynamic data.

        - Only write the code for the component; Do not write extra code to
        import it! The code will directly be stored in an individual .tsx file!

        - Very important: Your component should be exported as default!
